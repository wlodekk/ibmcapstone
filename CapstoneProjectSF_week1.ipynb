    "The goal of this project will be to find the best location for a Mexican restaurant in San Francisco, CA. As defined by the Investor this will be a premium restaurant, aimed mainly at 30-40 year old clientele. One of the main attractions will be the high quality of the food. At first we assume the the main customers will be the inhabitants of the neighboring areas, with a strong emphasis on clients with Mexican origin. "

ICPSR is an Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research.\n",
    "Machine learning clustering on the relevant census tracts data will be carried out to identify the preferable neighboorhood.\n",
    "The key data used to cluster the tracts will be:\n",
    "* the average number of the population with income above 100k$ per square mile (the highest threshold in the census data),  \n",
    "* the average number of the Hispanic population per square mile- the majority of Hispanic population in SanFrancisco are of Mexican origin,\n",
    "* the average number of the 30-40 year old population per square mile,\n",

    "Information about the the competition in the selected area will be obtained with the Foursquare API. Two key factors will analysed using this data:\n",
    "* location of other Mexican restaurants - the restaurant should be located as far as possible from the direct competitors,\n",
    "* location of other restaurants - locating the restaurant next to other restaurants which are not direct competitors could be even beneficial (poossiblity of taking over their clients)."
